## Introduction

- This project aims to be a playground to learn [ESP32](http://esp32.net/) + [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/en) technology during the summer :)
- The idea is to use an ESP32 kit with LoRa + GPS + battery capabilities that will send the GPS coordinates through LoRa. Then we will receive these coordinates with another ESP32 device with LoRa capabilities.


## System

### Hardware
- Transmitter:
  - [LILYGO TTGO T-Beam V1.1 ESP32](http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50060&Id=1317&FId=t3:50060:3)
- Receiver:
  - Any ESP32 with LoRaWAN capabilities:
    - Heltec WiFi Kit 32 + Lora SX1278

### Software
- IDE: [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- Framework: [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/en)


## Work done

### Features working
- [x] GPS
- [x] Screen SSD1306 
- [x] LoRa
- [ ] Battery

### Tasks done
- [x] Get GPS position
- [x] Show GPS position in screen 
- [x] Send GPS position via LoRa
- [x] Show sending position via LoRa in screen
- [ ] Show battery status


## How to build and flash

- First, you will need to set up the Espressif environment. You can follow the [Get Started](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4.2/esp32/get-started/index.html).

### Transmitter
- Connect your device to the USB port.
  ```
  cd kids_lora_gps_tx
  idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash monitor
  ```

#### Configuration
- Default configuration will work for LILYGO TTGO T-Beam V1.1 ESP32 but you can use another device. In that case, you should do a `idf.py menuconfig` and configure:
  - NMEA parser / UART RXD pin number
  - Component config / LoRa Configuration
  - Component config / LVGL configuration
  - Component config / LVGL TFT Display controller


### Receiver
- Connect your device to the USB port.
  ```
  cd kids_lora_gps_rx
  idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash monitor
  ```

#### Configuration
- Default configuration will work for LILYGO TTGO T-Beam V1.1 ESP32 but you can use another device. In that case, you should do a `idf.py menuconfig` and configure:
  - Component config / LoRa Configuration
  - Component config / LVGL configuration
  - Component config / LVGL TFT Display controller


## Tests

- It is just a trial to test a component to learn how it works. Do not expect to see a lot of tests ;)

### Unit test (Linux host)
- No need for any device.
  ```
  cd components/gps/gps_cbor_coders/test/host_test
  idf.py build
  ./build/test_host_gps_cbor_coders.elf
  ```

### Unit test (Target)
- Connect your device to the USB port.
  ```
  cd components/gps/gps_cbor_coders/test/target_test
  idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash monitor
  ```


## CLion
- Follow this [ESP-IDF Clion guideline](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/esp-idf.html)
- How to load rx, tx and tests `CMakeLists.txt`:
  - `kids_lora_gps_rx`:
    - Use the Project Tool Window to navigate to `kids_lora_gps_rx/CMakeLists.txt` and click with right mouse button and choose `Load CMake Project`.
  - `kids_lora_gps_tx`:
    - Use the Project Tool Window to navigate to `kids_lora_gps_tx/CMakeLists.txt` and click with right mouse button and choose `Load CMake Project`.
  - Tests:
    - Host test:
      - You will need an extra CMake profile: 
        - Go to `Settings - Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake`. Add a new profile with and add the environment variable: `IDF_TARGET=linux`.
        - Remember to go to `Tools - CMake - Reset Cache and Reload Project`.
      - Use the Project Tool Window to navigate to `components/gps/gps_cbor_coders/test/host_test/CMakeLists.txt` and click with right mouse button and choose `Load CMake Project`.
    - Target test:
      - Use the Project Tool Window to navigate to `components/gps/gps_cbor_coders/test/target_test/CMakeLists.txt` and click with right mouse button and choose `Load CMake Project`.
